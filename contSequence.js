loop through 
have variable to keep of the highest sum.

loop through for each number.
loop through once checking each number against each other number.
add them up. 
Check it against the running total of the hightest sum.



{i: 0, k: the adding number, total: 0}

{i: 0, k: 0, total: 0}
{i: 1, k: 0, total: 0}
if index at k plus the total is greater than the total.



const highestSequence = (arr) => {
  let highest = {highest: 0, i: }

  for(let i = 0; i< arr.length; i++ ) {
    for(let k = i ; k<arr.length; k++) {
      arr[i]

    }
  }

}


const numbers = [2, 3, -8, -1, 2, 4, -2, 3]
console.log(highestSequence(numbers))
